Hi, I’m @SakaNight 👋

💻 I'm a full-stack developer and machine learning engineer passionate about building intelligent, production-ready systems—from interactive web apps to scalable AI services.

🚀 Recent Highlights:

🔧 **Task Management System**  
A full-stack productivity app with JWT auth, task filters, file uploads, and statistics. Built with **Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL**, Dockerized and CI/CD-ready.  

🧠 **Medical Image Classification with Transformers**  
Benchmarked **ViT and CMT models** on chest X-ray datasets with different attention mechanisms. Implemented and evaluated training pipelines using **PyTorch**.  

🧪 **Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Traffic Sign Recognition**  
Designed and deployed a hybrid **QCNN** using Qiskit and PyTorch, demonstrating comparative results with classical CNNs.

🤖 **LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering**  
Exploring use of **LLMs** (e.g., ChatGPT, open-source models) for document tagging, summarization, and intelligent API assistants. Prompt tuning and inference API integration with FastAPI.

📚 Currently Exploring:
- LLM fine-tuning & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- System design and backend scalability patterns  
- MLOps tools like Ray, KServe, and Helm for model deployment

🌐 Portfolio projects & write-ups coming soon!  

🎮 Fun fact: I play D&D and love writing branching storylines for my characters!
